## Welcome to VisuALS for Windows!

Our mission is to love our neighbors by restoring independence, dignity, and hope through affordable assistive technology solutions. Specifically, VisuALS is a software package (in several versions) that enables those with debilitating conditions to use their eyes to communicate. The software works with off-the-shelf computers and eye-tracking devices to allow the patient to speak (text-to-speech), browse the web, access social networks, and use other applications.

### Not being able to communicate is tough.

When your loved one is unable to communicate because of conditions such as ALS, Stroke, or non-verbal autism, it’s easy to get frustrated and have your loved one experience a locked-inside syndrome. 

We understand what it’s like taking ten to thirty minutes to figure out what your loved one is trying to say. Also, it’s totally normal to worry about their mental health. And you’re not alone. 

### This is what you can do with a VisuALS System:

VisuALS is an assistive communication device that helps those who have lost their voice to communicate again.

#### Text-To-Speech

Using eye-tracking technology, express your needs, feelings, and communicate with our on-screen keyboard and predictive text. 

#### Notepad

Type out notes, longer thoughts, speeches, prayers, or whatever else is on their heart. They can then save it as a file and open it later.

#### Web Browser

Our unique web browser allows users to surf the internet, send emails, access social networks, and more.

#### Home Automation

Use our system with Amazon Echo Dot to turn on and off the lights, change TV channels, and so much more.
